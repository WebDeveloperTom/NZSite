            <br>
            <p>New Zealand was one of the last pieces of land to be settled by humans. Historians suggest that New Zealand was first settled less than 800 years ago by Eastern Polynesians between 1250 and 1300. These settlers would go on to become the Maori, the
              indigenous people of New Zealand.</p>
            <br>
            <p>It wasn't until about 300 years later that the first Europeans reached New Zealand, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman and his crew landed in 1642. This trip was short lived however as thier first encounter with the Maori was a hostile one. Four members
              of the Dutch crew were killed and at least one Maori was injured.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Europeans did not come back to New Zealand until 1769, 127 years later, when James Cook mapped the coastline. After this, many people began to visit New Zealand. Numerous European and North American whaling, sealing and trading ships as well as a
              number of Christian missionaries who eventually settled in New Zealand.</p>

            <p>In 1835, an adventurer named Charles de Thierry announced that he would be attempting establish his own sovereign state in New Zealand. This prompted the United Tribes of New Zealand to seek help from the British, they sent a Declaration of
              Independence to King William IV asking for protection.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The dubious legal standing of the Declaration of Independence prompted the British Colonial Office to send Captain William Hobson to claim sovereignty for the United Kingdom and negotiate a treaty with the Maori.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This paved the way for the Treaty of Waitangi, which was first signed in the Bay of Islands on 6 February 1840. The Treaty was created with the intention of establishing a British Governor of New Zealand, recognising Maori ownership of their
              lands, forests and other possessions, and giving Maori the rights of British citizens.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The Treaty of Waitangi is regarded as the founding document of New Zealand. Waitangi Day was established as a national holiday in 1974 and commemorates the date of the signing of the Treaty.</p>
